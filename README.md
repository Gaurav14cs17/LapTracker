# LapTracker
A simple linear assignment problem (LAP) object tracker that can handle gaps, splits and merges in object tracks. The tracking approach is based on: 

Jaqaman, K., Loerke, D., Mettlen, M. et al. Robust single-particle tracking in live-cell time-lapse sequences. Nat Methods 5, 695â€“702 (2008). https://doi.org/10.1038

However, some of the details were simplified, since this tracker is mainly supposed to be helpfull to track segmented objects (e.g. cells, nuclei) instead of single particles.

# Example #1: track objects from pandas DataFrame
There are at the moment two ways to use this tracker. The first one is to use it to track objects for which you have a pandas DataFrame of features. The DataFrame needs to at least include the x coordinates, y coordinates and timepoint. You can use the LapTracker in this case like this:

```python
from LapTracker.LapTracker import *
import numpy as np

df = np.random.choice(2000, [500, 4], replace=False)
df[:, 2] = np.repeat(np.arange(0, 50), 10)
columns = ['x_coordinates', 'y_coordinates', 'timepoints', 'labels']
df = pd.DataFrame(df, columns=columns)


tracker = LapTracker(max_distance=50, time_window=4, max_split_distance=50,
                     max_gap_closing_distance=150)
tracker.track_df(df, identifiers=columns)
tracked_df = tracker.df
```

The df attribute of the tracker will be the same DataFrame with some additional columns. The track_id is the most important one, as it tells you which track the object is finally assigned to.

# Example #2: track objects from label image stack
In case you have label images of your objects for each timepoint, you can use a different functionality of the tracker:

```python
from LapTracker.LapTracker import *
from skimage.io import imread

# load your image stack. should be t * x * y.
stack = imread('my_label_stack.tiff')
tracker = LapTracker(max_distance=50, time_window=4, max_split_distance=50,
                     max_gap_closing_distance=150)
tracker.track_label_images(stack)

```

After processing, the tracker object will have the attributes "relabeled_movie" (a numpy array in which the objects are relabeled according to their track id) and "df" (a pd.DataFrame containing the centroid measurements of the objects as well as unique_id, segment_id and track_id)

# Example #3: track objects from label image stack with additional intensity information
In case you think the object intensities could be helpful for your tracking problem, you can also give them as input. The object intensities will be used to adapt the cost for splits and merges of track segments:

```python
from LapTracker.LapTracker import *
from skimage.io import imread

# load your image stack. should be t * x * y.
label_stack = imread('my_label_stack.tiff')
intensity_stack = imread('my_intensity_stack.tiff')
tracker = LapTracker(max_distance=50, time_window=4, max_split_distance=50,
                     max_gap_closing_distance=150)
tracker.track_label_images(label_stack=label_stack, intensity_stack=intensity_stack)
